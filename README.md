# PC-Softsynth 2

A next iteration of the PC-Softsynth. 

At this stage is simply a copy of the first version
The program allows to edit and play 8-bit Atari Softsynth music 
using 44 kHz/16 bit sampling instead of 11 kHz/4 bit as in original Atari Softsynth

The goal is to create a SDL2 based version of the program
with better sample parameters, visualizations and maybe tracker capabilities.
